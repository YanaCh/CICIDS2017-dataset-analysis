# Cyber-Attacks Detection in IoT-Based Smart City Applications

##### The dataset used in the project was generated by the Canadian Institute for Cybersecurity (CIC) in 2017. It consists of 8 tables with data regarding different types of cyber-attacks. Each row of the table in the dataset corresponds to .pcap file, which encapsulates information or features of network traffic.

`PreProcessing.ipynb ` reports about:
- attacks type's distribution presented in the dataset;
- attacks type's distribution selected for training a machine learning.

`FeatureSelection.ipynb`:
- performing a data cleaning, removing rows with infinite values and columns with only one percent of unique values;
- applying **ANOVA F-test** feature selection approach;
- checking **ANOVA F-test** assumptions; 
- applying **Mutual Information** approach for feature selection;
- deleting highly correlated columns from the dataset.

`Model.ipynb`:
- use of different machine learning algorithms for data training;
- comparing accuracy scores.
